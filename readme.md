# Artistic Style Emulation with ArtGAN

## Objective

The objective of this project is to emulate the painting styles of an old artist through the development of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model. The GAN is trained to recreate images that capture the essence of the old artist's distinctive style. This is achieved using a limited set of samples, consisting of only 150 images.

## ArtGAN Model

To accomplish the task of replicating artistic styles, I employed a specialized GAN architecture known as ArtGAN[1]. Unlike traditional GANs, ArtGAN[1] is specifically designed for generating images with artistic attributes. It focuses on capturing the unique characteristics present in various art forms, including paintings and sculptures.

## Training Process

The training process involves exposing the ArtGAN[1] model to a dataset comprising a diverse collection of artistic images. By learning from this dataset, the model gains an understanding of different artistic elements such as brush strokes, color palettes, and composition. As a result, the trained ArtGAN[1] can generate new images that exhibit similar artistic attributes to those found in the training data.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory and set up your environment.
3. Run the provided scripts to train the ArtGAN[1] model on your own dataset or the provided sample dataset.
4. Experiment with the trained model to generate new images that resemble the old artist's style.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with the ArtGAN model to generate your own artistic images reminiscent of the old artist's style.

**Note:** This project was inspired by the works of an old artist and aims to pay homage to their unique artistic style through the capabilities of GAN technology.
